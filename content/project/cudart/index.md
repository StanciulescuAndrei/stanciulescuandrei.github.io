This is a C++/CUDA project following the [Ray-Tracing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book. As an addition to it, my implementation computes the light path using CUDA kernels and displays the result continuously using the OpenGL-CUDA interoperability interface. It supports diffuse and metallic (with fuzz) materials, as well as grid-structured MSAA. As I advance more through the book, I will add more functionalities.
