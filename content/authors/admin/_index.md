## About Me

I am a Graphics Programmer who graduated with a MSc in Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality from UPC. My experience is mostly in research environments, both in my home country, working on volumetric reconstruction for 3D X-Ray imaging, as well as abroad, working in the ViRVIG research group on a R&D project in partnership with HP focused on building the geometry processing pipeline for their high-resolution 3D printers. The master's program finished with a 6 month research mobility at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, where I worked on my thesis on extending the renderer for 3D Gaussian Splatting models.

My areas of interest are mainly geometry processing, rendering and image/volume reconstruction, both for camera-based methods and for non-destructive testing applications.
