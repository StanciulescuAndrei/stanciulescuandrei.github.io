ABSTRACT = {Given its essential role in body functions, liver cancer is the third most common cause of death from cancer, despite being the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide. Following advancements in medicine and image processing, medical image segmentation methods are receiving a great deal of attention. As a novelty, the paper proposes an intelligent decision system for segmenting liver and hepatic tumors by integrating four efficient neural networks (ResNet152, ResNeXt101, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3). Images from computed tomography for training, validation, and testing were taken from the public LiTS17 database and preprocessed to better highlight liver tissue and tumors. Global segmentation is done by separately training individual classifiers and the global system of merging individual decisions. For the aforementioned application, classification neural networks have been modified for semantic segmentation. After segmentation based on the neural network system, the images were postprocessed to eliminate artifacts. The segmentation results obtained by the system were better, from the point of view of the Dice coefficient, than those obtained by the individual networks, and comparable with those reported in recent works.},
